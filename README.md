# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

List of Experiments
Part - A

1. Create multiple network slices for different services (e.g., eMBB, URLLC, mMTC) and simulate their performance under various traffic loads.
2. Simulate mmWave propagation in urban and indoor environments, analyze path loss models and evaluate penetration and diffraction effects.
3. Simulate a massive MIMO system with different numbers of antennas and users. Measure the system performance metrics.
4. Simulate various beamforming algorithms (e.g., analog, digital, and hybrid beamforming) and evaluate their performance in different scenarios.
5. Simulate scenarios with and without carrier aggregation and measure the resulting throughput and bandwidth efficiency.
